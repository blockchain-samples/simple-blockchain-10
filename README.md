# EZ-blockchain
A blockchain network, meant to serve educational and testing purposes

In this code base, I intend to create a C++ implementation of a blockchain. I go about this project with the intention to try things and
simplify a blockchain. Through this project, I will use my own hashing algorithms and list my assumptions and shortfalls relative to security
privacy, tracability etc. 

Eventually, this code base will be updated with a front end UI - as my experiences increase. 

My goal is to create some working trial of a blockchain mostly as a test for myself. Feel free to branch off and use what I've written
